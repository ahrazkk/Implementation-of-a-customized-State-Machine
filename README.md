# Implementation-of-a-customized-State-Machine
design a finite state machine (FSM) that cycles through the individual digits of your student code

The project focused on the implementation of a customized state machine using VHDL for sequential circuits. The main objectives were to simulate and verify the operation of the sequential circuit and design a finite state machine (FSM) that cycles through the individual digits of a student ID. The project involved the utilization of Mealy or Moore machines, depending on the assigned state diagrams.

Before proceeding with the project, preparatory steps included creating state tables, state-assigned tables, and logic equations for Flip-Flop inputs. Students were also required to draw logic diagrams corresponding to their assigned state machine.

During the project, students implemented their designs by considering the sequence of digits in the student ID and handling non-valid states and identifier cases. The results were displayed using a seven-segment module. Various figures and a VHDL code template were provided to guide the students.

Overall, the project aimed to provide practical experience in designing and implementing a customized state machine for sequential circuits.
